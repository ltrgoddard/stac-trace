# stac-trace

Minimal tool for exploring [STAC catalogues](https://stacspec.org/en). Ultimate purpose: surfacing interesting locations that other people have tasked high-resolution satellite imagery of in recent months. 'What's being watched?' Start with a shell script-based command-line tool, then we'll expand into a Mapbox map later on.

## System

- Use UP42 [API docs](https://developer.up42.com/reference/overview) to work out how to query
- UP42 credentials in `.env`
